Here are some basic instructions for getting rollbar up and running on your project.

Step 1) Install rollbar as a package in your project
    Use npm i rollbar
Step 2) Add rollbar to your server file
    Three things:
        One - const Rollbar = require('rollbar') - you need to capitalize rollbar here since it is a class - you are intializing Rollbar here, essentially telling your server file you intend to set up access to Rollbar
        Two - const rollbar = new Rollbar( {
            accessToken: '', - access token is obtained from rollbar.com
            captureUncaught: true,
            captureUnhandledRejections: true
            }) - here we are defining what rollbar is, essentially creating an access port for rollbar.com to gain entry to your project
        Three - invoke rollbar with the following - app.use(rollbar.errorHandler());

Step 3) Get access token from rollbar.com and put the access key in your server file
    Couple of things:
        One - click new project
        Two - select which framework you used to build your project
        three - copy the access token and paste it into your server file at accessToken: 'pastehere'
